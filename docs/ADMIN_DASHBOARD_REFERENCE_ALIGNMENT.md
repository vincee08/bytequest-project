# Admin Dashboard Reference Alignment

Date: 2026-08-12

The supplied Admin dashboard screenshots were used as visual and information-architecture references. The implementation preserves ByteQuest's existing Next.js, Supabase, RLS, and role boundaries and only renders values available from the authoritative project schema.

## Implemented reference-aligned surfaces

| Reference area | ByteQuest implementation | Truth source |
|---|---|---|
| Grouped Admin sidebar | Dashboard, User management, System, Insights, Security & Audit, Account | `ByteQuest-Web-Dashboard/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` |
| KPI row | Responsive four-card `MetricStrip` with role-specific metrics and links | `profiles`, `classes`, Admin analytics RPC, `system_settings` |
| Platform activity trend | Seven-day line chart for assessments, released results, and resources | `get_admin_system_analytics` |
| Account status summary | Donut and readable legend grouped by role/status | `get_admin_system_analytics` |
| TESDA source readiness | Version list with status, edition, and update date | `tesda_sources` |
| Private resource storage | MIME-family inventory, recorded bytes, and resource count | `learning_resources` |
| Recent audit activity | Outcome-tagged event list | append-only `audit_events` |
| Governance attention | Pending source validation and non-success audit signals | `tesda_sources`, `audit_events` |
| Users / Instructors / Learners | Real account metrics and responsive governance tables | `profiles`, `classes`, `class_memberships` |
| Access & Scope | Class-owner scope, active memberships, and attached resources | `classes`, `class_memberships`, `learning_resources` |
| Resource Governance | Private resource lifecycle and storage metadata | `learning_resources` |
| System Analytics / Reports | Existing period-scoped Admin RPC visualizations and reports | `get_admin_system_analytics` |
| Security / Audit | Account posture and recorded non-success operations | `profiles`, `audit_events` |
| Settings & Governance | Audited system settings and source-policy warning | `system_settings` |

## Deliberately not copied from the references

The screenshots contain illustrative values and controls that are not present in ByteQuest's approved schema. The dashboard therefore does **not** fabricate:

- account growth percentages, sparkline deltas, or trend claims without a comparison query;
- security scores, MFA adoption, IP locations, malware events, or leaked-password counts without an authoritative source;
- storage capacity percentages when only recorded resource bytes are available;
- report schedulers, generated-export histories, or policy scans without persisted workflows;
- TESDA readiness percentages or competency scores without approved provenance.

These omissions are intentional. The visual hierarchy is inspired by the reference while every number remains traceable to live PostgreSQL data.

## Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` â€” PASS
- `pnpm lint` â€” PASS with no warnings/errors
- `pnpm test:analytics` â€” PASS, 4/4
- `pnpm build` â€” PASS
- Local `/admin/dashboard` route â€” HTTP 200 after production-build restart

The authenticated Admin route/RBAC and governance smoke evidence remains in `docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DESTINATION_AUDIT.md` and the final acceptance report.
