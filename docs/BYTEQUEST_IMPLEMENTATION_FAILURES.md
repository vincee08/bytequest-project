# ByteQuest Implementation Failure Log

## 2026-08-20 20:31:08 +08:00 — Simulation framework discovery path

- Operation: Read the active simulation framework during repository discovery.
- Command: `Get-Content -Raw .\ByteQuest-Mobile-App\lib\screens\simulation\simulation_framework.dart`
- Affected location: PowerShell discovery probe line 7; requested repository path did not exist.
- Observed result: `PathNotFound`.
- Root cause: The framework is under `lib/screens/simulation/components/simulation_framework.dart`.
- Primary solution: Correct the path and read or modify the file at its actual component path.
- Alternatives: Locate it with `rg --files -g simulation_framework.dart`; or import the extracted component files directly after the scene-engine task.
- Status: Resolved.

## 2026-08-20 21:19:53 +08:00 — SDD workspace helper access

- Operation: Start the SDD workspace helper.
- Command: `scripts/sdd-workspace`
- Affected location: WSL/Bash startup; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: WSL/Bash failed to start with `E_ACCESSDENIED`.
- Root cause: The helper could not access the WSL/Bash environment.
- Primary solution: Use the documented PowerShell-equivalent `.superpowers/sdd/<plan>/` layout.
- Alternatives: Enable WSL; use Git Bash.
- Status: Bypassed and resolved operationally.

## 2026-08-20 21:22:17 +08:00 — Flutter SDK-cache access

- Operation: Establish the Flutter baseline and run the initial dependency/test probe.
- Command: `flutter --version`; `flutter pub get`; `flutter test`
- Affected location: Flutter SDK cache; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: `flutter --version` and the initial `flutter pub get`/`flutter test` probe produced no output until interrupted.
- Root cause: Restricted SDK-cache access.
- Primary solution: Run the approved `flutter` prefix with SDK-cache access.
- Alternatives: Prewarm Flutter outside the sandbox; configure a writable Flutter SDK/cache.
- Status: Resolved; Flutter 3.47.1 and all 50 baseline tests passed.

## 2026-08-20 22:19:26 +08:00 — Task 2 Dart formatter stall

- Operation: Format Task 2 runtime model/test.
- Command: `dart format lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_models.dart test/mission_runtime_models_test.dart`
- Affected code: `lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_models.dart` and `test/mission_runtime_models_test.dart`; formatter produced no diagnostic line.
- Observed result: Stalled without output twice and was interrupted.
- Root cause: Dart/Flutter SDK process access/lock behavior in the managed environment; exact internal cause was not emitted.
- Primary solution: Use the approved Flutter SDK-cache execution context and retry targeted formatting.
- Alternatives: Run `flutter format` if supported; run the SDK's `dart.exe format` directly; rely temporarily on targeted analyzer and `git diff --check` (both passed), then format from the IDE.
- Status: Bypassed for Task 2; source tests/analyzer clean.

## 2026-08-20 22:19:48 +08:00 — Task 2 failure-entry patch context

- Operation: Append the required Task 2 formatter entry to the implementation failure log.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` using the rendered heading as context.
- Affected location: `docs/BYTEQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURES.md`; line not applicable because no edit was applied.
- Observed result: Patch verification failed because the rendered em dash did not match the file's UTF-8 text.
- Root cause: The PowerShell output rendered the UTF-8 heading with mojibake, and that rendered text was reused as patch context.
- Primary solution: Anchor the patch on the preceding ASCII-only status line.
- Alternatives: Inspect the file as UTF-8 before patching; use a smaller ASCII-only context block.
- Status: Resolved; the required Task 2 entry was appended.

## 2026-08-20 22:20:35 +08:00 — Task 3 Dart formatter stall

- Operation: Format the Task 3 runtime, service, and test files.
- Command: `dart format lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_evidence_gateway.dart lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_controller.dart lib/services/authoritative_assessment_service.dart lib/services/progress_resume_service.dart test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart`
- Affected code: The six named Task 3 files; the formatter produced no diagnostic line.
- Observed result: Stalled without output until interrupted after 40 seconds.
- Root cause: The `dart` launcher encountered the same managed-environment SDK process access/lock behavior seen in Task 2; no internal diagnostic was emitted.
- Primary solution: Run the Flutter SDK's `dart.exe format` directly in the approved SDK-cache execution context.
- Alternatives: Run `flutter format` if supported; format from the IDE; use targeted analyzer and `git diff --check` as temporary syntax/whitespace checks.
- Status: Resolved; direct `dart.exe format` formatted all six files successfully.

## 2026-08-20 22:22:21 +08:00 — Task 3 targeted analyzer warnings

- Operation: Analyze the Task 3 runtime boundary, modified services, and focused tests.
- Command: `flutter analyze lib/screens/simulation/runtime lib/services/authoritative_assessment_service.dart lib/services/progress_resume_service.dart test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart --no-fatal-infos`
- Affected code: `lib/services/progress_resume_service.dart:73`, `:109`, and `:163`.
- Observed result: Analyzer exited with three `unawaited_return_in_try_block` warnings.
- Root cause: SharedPreferences futures were returned directly from `try` blocks, so asynchronous failures would bypass the methods' catch-based safe fallback.
- Primary solution: Await each SharedPreferences write/removal inside its `try` block.
- Alternatives: Move exception handling to callers; attach explicit error handlers to each returned future.
- Status: Resolved in source; targeted analyzer was rerun clean.

## 2026-08-20 22:25:41 +08:00 — Combined formatter/test Flutter startup stall

- Operation: Format the fail-closed adapter change and rerun focused Task 3 tests in one PowerShell process.
- Command: Flutter SDK `dart.exe format` for the service/test followed by `flutter test test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart`.
- Affected code: `lib/services/authoritative_assessment_service.dart` and `test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart`; the test runner itself did not start emitting test output.
- Observed result: Direct formatting completed, then Flutter startup stalled silently for 40 seconds and was interrupted.
- Root cause: Managed-environment Flutter SDK process access/lock behavior; four long-running Dart processes were present, but no diagnostic identified a specific lock owner.
- Primary solution: Run the focused Flutter test as a standalone approved command after the formatter process exits.
- Alternatives: Retry after prewarming the Flutter tool; run the test from the IDE; restart only a confirmed stale SDK process.
- Status: Resolved operationally; the standalone focused command started and exposed a separate test expectation mismatch.

## 2026-08-20 22:26:18 +08:00 — Fail-closed adapter test expectation mismatch

- Operation: Run the focused Task 3 tests after adding the inactive-attempt adapter guard.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart`
- Affected code: `lib/services/authoritative_assessment_service.dart:52` and `test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart:42`.
- Observed result: The guard threw `StateError` synchronously while the test expected the returned future to emit it.
- Root cause: `append` returned a Future by signature but was not `async`, so its precondition exception escaped before `expectLater` received the future.
- Primary solution: Make the transport method `async` and await the queued recorder so failures consistently use the interface's asynchronous error channel.
- Alternatives: Wrap the call in `Future.sync` in the test; assert the synchronous call with `expect`.
- Status: Resolved; the focused tests passed with asynchronous transport semantics.

## 2026-08-20 22:26:31 +08:00 — Multi-file patch header omission

- Operation: Apply the asynchronous adapter fix and update its failure-log entry together.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` across the assessment service and failure log.
- Affected location: No file was changed by the failed patch; line not applicable.
- Observed result: Patch verification searched for a documentation status line in the Dart service file and failed.
- Root cause: The patch omitted the second `Update File` header before the documentation hunk.
- Primary solution: Restore the explicit file header for each multi-file patch section.
- Alternatives: Apply one file per patch; keep hunks grouped under clearly separated file headers.
- Status: Resolved; the corrected multi-file patch applied.

## 2026-08-20 22:28:28 +08:00 — Task 3 worktree index access

- Operation: Stage the verified Task 3 implementation, tests, and failure ledger.
- Command: `git add -- ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_evidence_gateway.dart ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_controller.dart ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/services/authoritative_assessment_service.dart ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/services/progress_resume_service.dart ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_evidence_gateway_test.dart ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart docs/BYTEQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURES.md`
- Affected location: Main repository worktree metadata `.git/worktrees/bytequest-simulation-platform/index.lock`; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Git could not create `index.lock` because sandboxed access was denied.
- Root cause: The isolated worktree's Git index is stored under the main repository metadata outside the workspace-write sandbox.
- Primary solution: Rerun the exact scoped staging command with approved Git metadata access.
- Alternatives: Have the parent session stage and commit the same explicit paths; expand the writable sandbox to the worktree metadata directory.
- Status: Resolved; the scoped staging command succeeded with approved access.

## 2026-08-20 23:20:51 +08:00 — Task 4 sandboxed Flutter SDK-cache write

- Operation: Run the focused responsive scene and framework widget tests.
- Command: Flutter SDK `dart.exe` invoking `flutter_tools.snapshot test test/simulation_scene_test.dart test/simulation_framework_test.dart --no-pub`.
- Affected location: Flutter SDK cache `<flutter-sdk>/bin/cache/libimobiledevice.stamp`; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Flutter exited before test discovery because it could not write the SDK stamp file.
- Root cause: The managed workspace sandbox permits project writes but not Flutter SDK-cache writes outside the workspace.
- Primary solution: Rerun the same focused test command in the approved Flutter SDK-cache execution context.
- Alternatives: Prewarm the Flutter cache outside the sandbox; configure a writable Flutter SDK clone; run the focused tests from the IDE.
- Status: Resolved operationally; the approved retry reached all focused tests and exposed a separate test expectation mismatch.

## 2026-08-20 23:22:29 +08:00 — Task 4 neutral hotspot icon expectation

- Operation: Run the focused responsive scene and framework widget tests after extraction.
- Command: `flutter test test/simulation_scene_test.dart test/simulation_framework_test.dart`
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/simulation_scene_test.dart:40`.
- Observed result: Fourteen tests passed; the visual-semantics test expected a generic add icon for a neutral port but the hotspot rendered its semantic cable icon.
- Root cause: The test incorrectly treated neutral state as replacing the object's identity icon; only selected, completed, and error states replace it with state-specific symbols.
- Primary solution: Expect the neutral port hotspot's cable icon while retaining exact semantic-state assertions for all four states.
- Alternatives: Use a generic hotspot type in the fixture; assert only that each state has an icon without checking the neutral identity glyph.
- Status: Resolved; controller verification reran both focused suites with all 15 tests passing.

## 2026-08-20 23:04:53 +08:00 — Task 4 worker Flutter and Dart startup stall

- Operation: Run the Task 4 red test and SDK version probes from the worker sandbox.
- Command: `flutter test test/simulation_scene_test.dart`; `flutter --version`; `dart --version`.
- Affected location: Managed Flutter/Dart startup environment; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Each launcher stalled without compiler or test output until interrupted after a bounded wait.
- Root cause: The worker sandbox could not complete the shared SDK startup/cache workflow while other managed SDK processes were active; no internal diagnostic identified a source-code failure.
- Primary solution: Use the approved Flutter SDK-cache execution context for targeted verification.
- Alternatives: Invoke the SDK's `dart.exe` directly for formatting and analysis; run the focused suites from the IDE; use controller verification in the approved context.
- Status: Resolved; direct SDK analysis found no issues and controller verification passed all 15 focused tests.

## 2026-08-20 23:46:57 +08:00 — Task 4 geometry fix numeric type boundary

- Operation: Run the new logical-workspace aspect-ratio regression after the first geometry implementation.
- Command: `flutter test test/simulation_scene_test.dart --plain-name "portrait and landscape preserve the 1200 by 720 workspace ratio"`
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/components/simulation_scene.dart:502`.
- Observed result: Test compilation failed because `Rect.fromLTWH` received `num` width and height values where `double` was required.
- Root cause: `num.clamp` widened the mapped hotspot dimensions after the inverse-scale minimum extent was introduced.
- Primary solution: Convert the two clamped dimensions to `double` at the mapping boundary.
- Alternatives: Declare typed intermediate doubles; use explicit conditional bounds instead of `clamp`; cast immediately before `Rect.fromLTWH`.
- Status: Resolved; the focused geometry regression passed, all 16 Task 4 widget tests passed, and targeted analysis found no issues.

## 2026-08-21 01:22:15 +08:00 — Task 6 authoritative compact toolbar overflow

- Operation: Run the Task 6 advanced interaction suite with the authoritative mission assessment regression suite.
- Command: `flutter test test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart test/authoritative_mission_assessment_widget_test.dart`
- Affected test locations: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/authoritative_mission_assessment_widget_test.dart:82` and `:134`; production source `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/components/simulation_scene.dart:204`.
- Observed result: The compact 320×568 case overflowed by 8.7 pixels on the right; the 1.8× large-text case overflowed by 68 pixels on the right.
- Root cause: `_SceneToolbar` placed the Objects text action and two 48 dp icon actions in a non-wrapping `Row`. Its children required 250.7 pixels within a 242-pixel compact action area, and text scaling increased that intrinsic width further.
- Primary solution: Replace the action `Row` with an end-aligned `Wrap`, preserving all labels, semantics, and 48 dp controls while allowing the actions to flow onto another line.
- Alternatives: Put the action row in a horizontal `SingleChildScrollView`; collapse secondary actions into an overflow menu at the compact breakpoint; or stack each action vertically under the scene title.
- Status: Resolved; the authoritative widget regression passed all three tests after the focused layout change.

## 2026-08-21 14:00:55 +08:00 — Task 8 combined launcher replacement patch rejection

- Operation: Apply the first bounded Task 8 runtime integration patch.
- Command: `apply_patch` with controller update, launcher delete/add, and runtime screen creation operations.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/mission_launcher.dart`; code line not applicable because the patch was rejected before mutation.
- Observed result: Patch verification rejected multiple operations targeting the launcher in one patch; no production changes from that patch were applied.
- Root cause: The patch attempted to delete and add the same file in a single `apply_patch` request, which the patch verifier treats as conflicting operations.
- Primary solution: Split the launcher replacement into sequential delete and add patches, then apply the controller and runtime screen changes independently.
- Alternatives: Use one direct `Update File` patch for the launcher or use smaller sequential patches anchored to existing sections.
- Status: Resolved; the split controller, launcher, and runtime screen patches applied successfully.

## 2026-08-21 14:04:28 +08:00 — Task 8 Flutter temporary compiler directory loss

- Operation: Run the first green Task 8 launcher and runtime screen test attempt.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_launcher_test.dart test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`
- Affected location: Flutter-managed `%TEMP%/flutter_tools.*` test listener and compiler output directories; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: The test compiler exited before compiling the suites because its generated listener and `output.dill` paths no longer existed.
- Root cause: Flutter's managed temporary test directory disappeared during compiler startup; the output contained no Dart source diagnostic from the Task 8 files.
- Primary solution: Run targeted analysis to surface source diagnostics independently, then retry the focused test command with a fresh Flutter test workspace.
- Alternatives: Run each test file separately; restart the Flutter tool process; or clear only the stale tool-owned temporary session after confirming no active process owns it.
- Status: Resolved operationally; verification continued through targeted analysis and a fresh focused-test retry.

## 2026-08-21 14:09:33 +08:00 — Task 8 shared Flutter SDK analysis lock stall

- Operation: Analyze the bounded Task 8 launcher, runtime screen, controller seam, and tests after implementation.
- Command: `flutter analyze lib/screens/simulation/mission_launcher.dart lib/screens/simulation/mission_simulation_screen.dart lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_controller.dart test/mission_launcher_test.dart test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart --no-fatal-infos`
- Affected location: Shared Flutter SDK/cache process state; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: The analyzer emitted no source diagnostic for two minutes and did not complete; the direct Dart analyzer later emitted its analysis banner but likewise failed to complete within a bounded wait while several other Dart processes were active.
- Root cause: Concurrent shared Flutter/Dart processes held or contended for managed SDK/cache analysis resources in the team environment.
- Primary solution: Stop only this task's stalled analyzer processes, allow the active shared SDK/cache work to settle, and retry from a fresh analyzer/test process; clean only stale tool-owned cache output if the retry still cannot start.
- Alternatives: Use the SDK's direct `dart.exe`, analyze from the IDE, or run the focused gates from the controller's approved Flutter execution context.
- Status: Resolved operationally; stalled processes owned by this task were stopped after bounded waits and verification continued with fresh focused commands.

## 2026-08-21 14:12:44 +08:00 — Task 8 review navigation test missed scrollable control

- Operation: Run the runtime shell widget suite after the launcher suite passed.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart:118`; production source line not applicable.
- Observed result: Nineteen checks passed, but the review navigation test tapped the Continue button while its center was below the 800×600 test viewport, so no phase navigation occurred and the expected review panel was absent.
- Root cause: The test did not scroll the intentionally scrollable controls pane before tapping an off-screen control.
- Primary solution: Call `WidgetTester.ensureVisible` before each Continue, Return, and Confirm tap so the test exercises the same scroll-then-activate behavior required from learners.
- Alternatives: Drag the controls pane explicitly before each tap or use a taller viewport for this navigation-only test while retaining the separate compact responsive matrix.
- Status: Resolved; the navigation harness now scrolls each target into view before activation.

## 2026-08-21 14:24:18 +08:00 — Task 8 ignored report staging rejection

- Operation: Stage the verified Task 8 implementation, failure ledger, and required SDD report for the integration commit.
- Command: `git add -- ... .superpowers/sdd/2026-08-20-bytequest-simulation-platform/task-8-report.md`
- Affected location: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-20-bytequest-simulation-platform/task-8-report.md`; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Git staged the implementation files but returned exit code 1 because `.superpowers/sdd/.gitignore` intentionally ignores all per-task SDD report artifacts.
- Root cause: The staging command included an environment-owned ignored report that is required for orchestration handoff but excluded from repository commits by the local SDD ignore policy.
- Primary solution: Leave the completed report at its required workspace path and commit only the repository-owned implementation, tests, and failure ledger.
- Alternatives: Force-add the report with `git add -f` if the repository owner explicitly changes the artifact policy, or copy its durable content into a tracked project document.
- Status: Resolved; the report remains available at the required path and the tracked Task 8 files remain staged for the exact requested commit.

## 2026-08-21 14:24:50 +08:00 — Task 8 cmd.exe commit-message quoting failure

- Operation: Create the verified Task 8 integration commit with the exact required message.
- Command: `git commit -m "feat: launch all missions through simulation runtime"` through the unified `cmd.exe` shell.
- Affected location: Git command invocation; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: The shell boundary passed the message as separate pathspec arguments, so Git returned exit code 1 without creating a commit or changing the staged content.
- Root cause: The unified `cmd.exe` invocation did not preserve the quoted multi-word `-m` argument as one value.
- Primary solution: Invoke the same exact Git commit message through PowerShell single-quote parsing after restaging this ledger entry.
- Alternatives: Escape the message for `cmd.exe` with verified caret quoting or use a temporary commit-message file created through an approved patch workflow.
- Status: Resolved operationally; no commit was created by the failed command and the staged implementation remained intact for the corrected invocation.

## 2026-08-21 14:51:43 +08:00 — Task 8 session-reset initial-state capture

- Operation: Run the first focused controller and runtime-screen verification after adding session-scoped persistence and invalid-phase recovery.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/mission_simulation_screen.dart` state initialization and `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart` invalid-phase reset regression.
- Observed result: Session-isolation and submission tests passed, but resetting an unknown restored phase returned to the same unknown phase and `_phaseIndex` correctly threw instead of falling back to phase zero.
- Root cause: The clean `_initialState` field used a lazy initializer, so its first read occurred after restore and captured the already-invalid restored controller state.
- Primary solution: Assign `_initialState` explicitly in `initState` before starting asynchronous restore.
- Alternatives: Construct a new clean runtime state inside the reset handler; have the controller retain its constructor state as a reset baseline.
- Status: Resolved; the focused controller/runtime rerun passed all 32 tests, including invalid-phase reset and both session-mismatch regressions.

## 2026-08-21 14:52:12 +08:00 — Task 8 failure-ledger patch encoding mismatch

- Operation: Append the session-reset verification failure to this ledger.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` using the console-rendered final Task 8 heading as context.
- Affected location: No file was changed by the rejected patch; code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Patch verification could not find the expected heading context.
- Root cause: PowerShell rendered the UTF-8 em dash as mojibake in the earlier console output, so the copied patch context did not match the file's actual Unicode text.
- Primary solution: Anchor the append to the preceding ASCII-only status line.
- Alternatives: Copy the raw UTF-8 heading from an editor; use a smaller sequential append patch with a different stable context line.
- Status: Resolved; the ASCII-anchored patch appended the failure entry successfully.

## 2026-08-21 15:04:50 +08:00 — Task 9 UI guidance search launcher failure

- Operation: Query the local UI/UX guidance for drag alternatives, reduced motion, and Flutter semantics before implementing the accessibility pass.
- Command: `python <skill-root>/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py ...` for the three targeted searches.
- Affected location: Local Python launcher configuration; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: All three searches exited before running because the configured Python interpreter was missing.
- Root cause: The registered Python 3 launcher target is stale or unavailable in the managed environment.
- Primary solution: Retry the same local search script with an available Python executable if one is discoverable, otherwise apply the skill's documented built-in accessibility defaults and repository acceptance criteria.
- Alternatives: Repair the Python launcher registration; run the script from a known working virtual environment; consult the checked-in quick reference directly.
- Status: Bypassed with the skill's built-in accessibility defaults; no repository implementation operation depended on the failed search.

## 2026-08-21 15:09:41 +08:00 — Task 9 semantics harness API mismatch

- Operation: Run the required initial Task 9 accessibility and design-system RED gate.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart test/learner_design_system_test.dart`
- Affected code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart:30`; the same run also produced the intended 44 dp theme failure at `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/learner_design_system_test.dart:27`.
- Observed result: The new matrix did not compile because `SemanticsNode` does not define `hasAction`; `SemanticsData` owns that API in the installed Flutter version.
- Root cause: The test queried a semantic action on the tree node instead of its resolved semantics data.
- Primary solution: Call `getSemanticsData().hasAction(SemanticsAction.tap)` on the resolved node and rerun the exact RED gate.
- Alternatives: Use Flutter's semantics matcher API; inspect `SemanticsData.actions` directly.
- Status: Resolved in the test harness; the intended production failures remain for the corrected RED rerun.

## 2026-08-21 15:11:53 +08:00 — Task 9 interaction driver missed rebuilds

- Operation: Rerun the corrected accessibility matrix to isolate production accessibility and motion failures.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart test/learner_design_system_test.dart`
- Affected test code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart:297`, `:317`, and `:330` after formatting; production source line not applicable to these three harness failures.
- Observed result: Placement looked for orientation before rebuilding after item selection, while observation and interpretation tapped their submit buttons before rebuilding their enabled state after text entry. The run separately retained the intended 44 dp theme failure and missing hotspot transition failures.
- Root cause: The matrix's tap driver omitted `pump()` calls between state-changing input and controls conditionally rendered or enabled by that state.
- Primary solution: Pump after selecting a placement item and after entering observation/interpretation text, then rerun the exact RED gate.
- Alternatives: Use `pumpAndSettle`; split each interaction driver into its own widget test with explicit rebuild points.
- Status: Resolved in the test harness; no production change was made for these driver-only failures.

## 2026-08-21 15:22:11 +08:00 — Task 9 targeted analyzer style finding

- Operation: Analyze the bounded Task 9 theme, motion components, interactions, and tests after the exact UI gate passed.
- Command: `flutter analyze lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart lib/screens/simulation/components/hotspot_widget.dart lib/screens/simulation/components/scene_connection_painter.dart lib/screens/simulation/interactions/multi_select_interaction.dart lib/screens/simulation/interactions/test_run_interaction.dart test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart test/learner_design_system_test.dart --no-fatal-infos`
- Affected code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/learner_design_system_test.dart:83`.
- Observed result: Analyzer completed with one `unnecessary_const` info on a nested `MediaQueryData` constructor.
- Root cause: The enclosing `const MediaQuery` already supplied a constant context, making the nested constructor modifier redundant.
- Primary solution: Remove only the redundant inner `const` and rerun targeted analysis.
- Alternatives: Remove the outer const instead; leave the non-fatal style info for a later cleanup.
- Status: Resolved in source; targeted analyzer rerun pending.

## 2026-08-21 15:25:45 +08:00 — Task 9 full analyzer bounded stop

- Operation: Run the plan's repository-wide mobile analyzer after the exact UI gate and clean targeted analyzer.
- Command: `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`
- Affected location: Full `ByteQuest-Mobile-App` analyzer process; application code line not applicable because no diagnostic was emitted.
- Observed result: Analysis started and printed `Analyzing ByteQuest-Mobile-App...` but did not finish or emit a source diagnostic within about 90 seconds, so this task's process was interrupted to keep the handoff bounded.
- Root cause: Full-project analyzer latency in the shared managed Flutter environment; no code-specific failure was reported.
- Primary solution: Use the completed exact 81-test UI gate and the clean targeted seven-file analyzer as Task 9 proof, and rerun full analysis in the parent/final integration gate.
- Alternatives: Run full analysis from the IDE; retry after shared Flutter processes settle; split analysis by remaining library/test directories.
- Status: Bounded and deferred to final integration; targeted analysis reports no issues.

## 2026-08-21 15:36:33 +08:00 — Task 9 review placement RED harness setup

- Operation: Inspect and run the first persisted-placement motion regression from the mobile directory.
- Command: `Get-Content ByteQuest-Mobile-App\test\core_mission_interactions_test.dart`; then `flutter test test/core_mission_interactions_test.dart --plain-name "controlled placement renders persisted placement with state motion"`.
- Affected test code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/core_mission_interactions_test.dart:491` and `:502`; production code was not reached by the failed compilation.
- Observed result: The inspection command duplicated the mobile path from an already-mobile working directory, and the test then failed to compile because the new assertions referenced `AppTheme` without importing it.
- Root cause: Two test-harness setup mistakes: a working-directory-relative path mismatch and a missing theme import.
- Primary solution: Inspect `test/core_mission_interactions_test.dart` relative to the mobile directory, import `app_theme.dart`, and rerun the same focused RED regression.
- Alternatives: Run inspection from the repository root; compare duration to a literal 200 ms value instead of the shared token.
- Status: Resolved in the test harness; intended production RED rerun pending.

## 2026-08-21 15:39:08 +08:00 — Task 9 placement motion patch context mismatch

- Operation: Apply the persisted-placement snap/fade implementation and align its focused regression with Flutter transition widgets.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` across `controlled_placement_interaction.dart` and `core_mission_interactions_test.dart`.
- Affected location: No file was changed by the rejected patch.
- Observed result: Patch verification could not match the formatted `AnimatedScale` assertion block in the test file.
- Root cause: The combined patch used pre-format assertion context that no longer exactly matched Dart formatter output.
- Primary solution: Apply a small test-only patch against the inspected formatted block, then apply the production widget patch separately.
- Alternatives: Use a smaller ASCII anchor around the test name; regenerate the whole test block after rereading it.
- Status: Resolved operationally; the rejected patch made no mutation.

## 2026-08-21 15:47:55 +08:00 — Task 9 test-run replacement patch conflict

- Operation: Replace the local timer-driven test interaction with a runtime-state renderer and add its screen transition in one patch.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` deleting and adding `test_run_interaction.dart` while updating `mission_simulation_screen.dart`.
- Affected location: No file was changed by the rejected combined patch.
- Observed result: Patch verification rejected multiple delete/add operations targeting the same Dart file.
- Root cause: The patch format does not accept deleting and adding one path in a single request.
- Primary solution: Apply the deletion first, then add the replacement and screen transition in a separate patch.
- Alternatives: Replace the file with one large `Update File` hunk; patch the class incrementally.
- Status: Resolved; the split replacement and screen transition patches applied.

## 2026-08-21 15:53:27 +08:00 — Task 9 matrix semantics disposal timing

- Operation: Run the hardened terminal-action and complete Android tap-target matrix.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart`
- Affected test code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_accessibility_matrix_test.dart` semantics handles in the per-family terminal tests and complete-target test.
- Observed result: All interaction assertions executed, but fifteen tests failed end-of-test verification because active `SemanticsHandle` objects were registered with `addTearDown` and therefore disposed after Flutter's handle check.
- Root cause: Widget-test semantics handles must be disposed inside the test body before Flutter performs end-of-test verification.
- Primary solution: Dispose each handle explicitly after its final assertion rather than through `addTearDown`.
- Alternatives: Wrap each test body in `try/finally` and dispose in `finally`; rely only on the accessibility guideline's internal semantics lifecycle where possible.
- Status: Resolved in the matrix harness; focused rerun pending.

## 2026-08-21 15:54:50 +08:00 — Task 9 review completed-state finder mismatch

- Operation: Verify the runtime-state-driven TestRun completion renderer after replacing the local timer.
- Command: `flutter test test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart --plain-name "test run renders and completes from persisted runtime state"`
- Affected test code: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart:157`; production renderer `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/interactions/test_run_interaction.dart`.
- Observed result: The action sequence and completed runtime state matched, but the exact semantics-label finder did not resolve the completed child while it was transitioning through `AnimatedSwitcher`.
- Root cause: The assertion coupled the persisted-state proof to transient merged-semantics lookup during an animated replacement.
- Primary solution: Assert the stable `test-run-completed` semantic widget key for state rendering; the accessibility matrix separately verifies semantic action and guideline behavior.
- Alternatives: Settle the transition before matching; inspect the resolved `SemanticsData` from the keyed node.
- Status: Resolved; the focused test and exact UI gate pass.

## 2026-08-21 16:01:35 +08:00 — Task 9 review round 2 stale source paths

- Operation: Inspect the test-run renderer and mission screen reducer before writing round-2 regressions.
- Command: `Get-Content ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/features/mission/presentation/widgets/test_run_interaction.dart; rg -n "placement_attempted" ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/features/mission/presentation/screens/mission_simulation_screen.dart`
- Affected location: Read-only inspection; no source or test file was changed.
- Observed result: PowerShell and `rg` reported both requested source paths did not exist.
- Root cause: The inspection command used an obsolete feature-layer path instead of the repository's current `lib/screens/simulation/...` paths.
- Primary solution: Locate the files with `rg --files` and inspect `lib/screens/simulation/interactions/test_run_interaction.dart` and `lib/screens/simulation/mission_simulation_screen.dart`.
- Alternatives: Search for the `TestRunInteraction` class and `placement_attempted` action symbols directly.
- Status: Resolved; the current files and reducer were located and inspected.

## 2026-08-21 16:02:20 +08:00 — Task 9 failure-ledger patch anchor mismatch

- Operation: Record the stale source-path inspection failure in the implementation failure ledger.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` anchored on the previously rendered mojibake form of the 15:54:50 heading.
- Affected location: `docs/BYTEQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURES.md`; the rejected patch made no mutation.
- Observed result: Patch verification could not find the expected heading line.
- Root cause: The terminal rendered the em dash with encoding artifacts, so the copied heading was not byte-identical to the file.
- Primary solution: Anchor the append on the stable ASCII final status line instead.
- Alternatives: Inspect the final lines with explicit UTF-8 output; anchor on several nearby ASCII-only bullet lines.
- Status: Resolved; this entry and the original failure entry were appended through the ASCII anchor.

## 2026-08-21 16:03:18 +08:00 — Task 9 review round 2 scheduler RED

- Operation: Prove that TestRun lacked delayed automatic completion through an injectable scheduler seam.
- Command: `flutter test test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart --plain-name "test run renders and completes from persisted runtime state"`
- Affected code/test: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/interactions/test_run_interaction.dart`; `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart:124-220,500-565,814-840`.
- Observed result: Test compilation failed because `TestRunScheduler`, `ScheduledTestRun`, and the `scheduler` constructor argument did not exist; the catalog test also exposed a fake-scheduler declaration inserted into the neighboring decision loop instead of the retest loop.
- Root cause: Production still offered learner-driven immediate completion with no scheduling boundary, and the initial regression patch matched an overly broad repeated loop anchor for one test-local declaration.
- Primary solution: Add the narrow scheduler interfaces and timer implementation, make TestRun schedule only while runtime state is `running`, and move the fake scheduler declaration into the catalog retest loop.
- Alternatives: Inject a timer factory callback; use `FakeAsync` against a private timer implementation while exposing only the configured duration.
- Status: Resolved; focused automatic-completion and cancellation regressions pass.

## 2026-08-21 16:04:42 +08:00 — Task 9 review round 2 incompatible-placement RED

- Operation: Prove the actual screen/controller flow does not install an incompatible component.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart --plain-name "incompatible placement never renders as installed"`
- Affected code/test: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/lib/screens/simulation/mission_simulation_screen.dart:491-500`; `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart:198-232`.
- Observed result: The regression failed at line 226: expected an empty placement map, but runtime state contained `{'memory': 'cpu-socket'}` and rendered the persisted placement as Installed.
- Root cause: The screen reducer persisted every `placement_attempted` action without requiring `value['compatible'] == true`.
- Primary solution: Reject missing or false compatibility before changing `MissionRuntimeState.placements`; retain the evidence action for authoritative review without rendering client success.
- Alternatives: Store accepted and rejected attempts in separate runtime fields; add a typed placement-result model and render accepted results only.
- Status: Resolved; the focused screen/controller regression passes and accepted evidence remains recorded.

## 2026-08-22 12:00:52 +08:00 — Task 10 isolated-worktree context-file lookup

- Operation: Resume Task 10 under the newly supplied standing repository instructions and read `CODEX_STATE.md` and `bytequest.md` before further work.
- Command: `Get-Content -Raw CODEX_STATE.md; Get-Content -Raw bytequest.md` from the isolated `feature/bytequest-simulation-platform` worktree.
- Affected location: Repository context lookup; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: PowerShell reported that both files were absent from the isolated worktree.
- Root cause: `CODEX_STATE.md`, `bytequest.md`, and `AGENTS.md` were added independently on `Dro-branch` after the feature worktree diverged from their common base.
- Primary solution: Read the canonical tracked copies from the repository root before continuing, then reconcile the documentation branches during final integration.
- Alternatives: Merge `Dro-branch` into the feature branch after resolving the duplicated mobile-folder rename; or create a fresh worktree from `Dro-branch` and transplant the reviewed feature commits.
- Status: Resolved for Task 10 context; all required documents were read in full from the canonical root checkout, with branch reconciliation deferred until implementation and QA are complete.

## 2026-08-22 12:04:34 +08:00 — Task 11 plan lookup from mobile directory

- Operation: Read the Task 11 emulator acceptance steps immediately before device detection.
- Command: `rg -n -A 100 -B 5 "Task 11" docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-20-bytequest-simulation-platform.md` from `ByteQuest-Mobile-App`.
- Affected location: Read-only plan lookup; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: `rg` reported that the relative plan path did not exist.
- Root cause: The command was run one directory below the repository root, so the repository-relative `docs/...` path resolved under the mobile project.
- Primary solution: Run the lookup from the repository root, then return to `ByteQuest-Mobile-App` for Flutter commands.
- Alternatives: Prefix the path with `..\`; or use the verified absolute worktree plan path.
- Status: Resolved; the complete Task 11 and Task 12 plan sections were read from the repository root.

## 2026-08-22 12:04:34 +08:00 — Task 11 Android emulator initially absent

- Operation: Detect the Android emulator required for the 20-mission device matrix.
- Command: `flutter devices --machine`.
- Affected location: Android development environment; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Flutter returned only Windows and Edge targets, with no running Android device.
- Root cause: The installed AVD existed but was not running at the start of Task 11.
- Primary solution: Enumerate AVDs with `flutter emulators`, then launch `my_android36_emulator` with `flutter emulators --launch my_android36_emulator`.
- Alternatives: Start the AVD through Android Studio Device Manager; install the APK through Android Studio; or connect a supported physical Android device with USB debugging.
- Status: Resolved; Flutter detected `emulator-5554`, Android 16/API 36, with hardware rendering enabled.

## 2026-08-22 12:05:46 +08:00 — Task 11 adb PATH resolution

- Operation: Launch the installed APK and inspect its process/activity state.
- Command: `adb -s emulator-5554 shell ...`.
- Affected location: Local Android SDK command resolution; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: PowerShell reported that `adb` was not recognized for each requested probe.
- Root cause: Android platform-tools was installed but its directory was not on the active PowerShell PATH.
- Primary solution: Invoke `C:\android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe` explicitly for all device operations.
- Alternatives: Add the platform-tools directory to the session PATH; use `flutter run -d emulator-5554`; or use Android Studio's device controls and Logcat.
- Status: Resolved; the explicit SDK executable launched the app, captured process/activity evidence, and exercised lifecycle/settings variants.

## 2026-08-22 12:08:23 +08:00 — Task 11 authenticated mission matrix blocked

- Operation: Enter and execute every mission from `coc1_m1` through `coc4_m5` on the Android emulator.
- Command/interaction: Launch the installed APK, complete onboarding, and open the learner login boundary; inspect only the presence of credential configuration without printing values.
- Affected location: Runtime authentication boundary; mission code line not applicable.
- Observed result: The canonical APK reached the learner login screen, but no authorized learner email/password or `BYTEQUEST_E2E_PASSWORD` was available in the environment. The mobile Supabase URL and anonymous key were configured, but they do not authorize a learner session.
- Root cause: Task 11 requires an authenticated learner account to reach assigned missions, while this environment supplies project connectivity only and intentionally contains no reusable user credentials.
- Primary solution: Rerun the documented 20-mission emulator matrix with an authorized disposable learner test account and record each live result without storing credentials in the repository.
- Alternatives: Execute a repository-owned authenticated integration harness that creates/cleans its own fixtures; have an instructor assign all 20 missions to a disposable learner and perform the matrix manually; or run the existing widget/catalog/launcher suites as non-device contract evidence while marking live checks unverified.
- Status: Externally blocked; no authentication bypass was added. All 20 launcher/catalog/runtime contracts remain automated-pass, while authenticated emulator interaction and submission are explicitly unverified.

## 2026-08-22 12:14:46 +08:00 — Task 12 pnpm command unavailable

- Operation: Run the repository's authenticated all-missions lifecycle command.
- Command: `pnpm test:all-missions` from `ByteQuest-Web-Dashboard`.
- Affected location: Local Node package-manager command resolution; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: PowerShell reported that `pnpm` was not recognized.
- Root cause: pnpm 11.17.0 is declared by the project but its executable shim is not on the active PATH.
- Primary solution: Use Corepack's project-pinned pnpm version or enable its shim, then rerun the unchanged package script.
- Alternatives: Invoke the package script's exact underlying Node command; use a project-local pnpm executable; or run the command from the repository's documented prepared development shell.
- Status: Bypassed for diagnosis with Corepack and the exact Node command; authenticated execution remains blocked by missing configuration.

## 2026-08-22 12:14:55 +08:00 — Task 12 Corepack pnpm dependency check

- Operation: Run the all-missions lifecycle package script using the pinned Corepack pnpm version.
- Command: `corepack pnpm test:all-missions`.
- Affected location: Local Corepack/pnpm process bootstrap; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Corepack resolved pnpm 11.17.0, but pnpm's dependency check spawned plain `pnpm install`, which was not available on PATH, and exited 1 before the lifecycle script.
- Root cause: The Corepack binary was callable directly, but no pnpm shim existed for its child process.
- Primary solution: Run the package script's exact underlying Node command to determine the next safe blocker without changing global tooling.
- Alternatives: Run `corepack enable` in an authorized prepared shell; add Corepack's shim directory to PATH; or install the pinned pnpm version locally.
- Status: Resolved diagnostically; the underlying script command was invoked directly and stopped safely on missing `.env.local`.

## 2026-08-22 12:15:09 +08:00 — Task 12 all-missions lifecycle configuration absent

- Operation: Execute the authenticated submit/evaluate/release lifecycle for all missions.
- Command: `node --env-file=.env.local ../scripts/authenticated-all-missions-lifecycle-e2e.mjs`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Web-Dashboard/.env.local`; lifecycle script code was not entered.
- Observed result: Node exited immediately with `.env.local: not found`.
- Root cause: The dashboard's gitignored Supabase/service-role/test-account configuration and `BYTEQUEST_E2E_PASSWORD` are intentionally absent in this workspace.
- Primary solution: Supply an authorized local `.env.local` and disposable E2E password, then run `pnpm test:all-missions` without committing or printing secrets.
- Alternatives: Run the script in CI with protected secret variables; use an authorized prepared test environment; or manually execute learner submit, instructor evaluation/release, and learner result verification while recording non-secret evidence.
- Status: Externally blocked and marked unverified; no Supabase request or database mutation occurred.

## 2026-08-22 12:15:14 +08:00 — Task 12 realtime lifecycle configuration absent

- Operation: Execute the authenticated learner-submit/instructor-view and instructor-release/learner-result realtime check.
- Command: `node --env-file=.env.local ../scripts/authenticated-realtime-sync-e2e.mjs`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Web-Dashboard/.env.local`; realtime script code was not entered.
- Observed result: Node exited immediately with `.env.local: not found`.
- Root cause: The required gitignored Supabase and disposable account credentials are not present in this workspace.
- Primary solution: Supply the authorized local environment and E2E password, then run `pnpm test:realtime` without exposing values.
- Alternatives: Run the realtime script in protected CI; verify the flow with separate learner and instructor sessions; or capture Supabase Realtime/log evidence from an authorized test project.
- Status: Externally blocked and marked unverified; no connection, subscription, or database mutation occurred.

## 2026-08-22 12:33:46 +08:00 — Task 12 mission-evidence RED gate

- Operation: Run the new phase-completion, practice-evidence, and mission-screen regressions before production implementation.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_phase_completion_policy_test.dart test/practice_mission_evidence_service_test.dart test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart:29` and the two intentionally absent production units.
- Observed result: Continue was callable before any interaction, the requested policy/service imports did not exist, and one new helper accidentally resolved `isEmpty` as a matcher instead of the collection property.
- Root cause: The first two failures reproduced the reviewed production gaps; the collection failure was a test-harness name collision.
- Primary solution: Preserve the production failures as RED evidence, qualify the helper with `this.isEmpty`, then implement the smallest policy and service boundaries.
- Alternatives: Split the three suites into separate RED commands; use a deliberately failing stub interface before adding the concrete units.
- Status: Resolved; the corrected tests fail only on the intended missing behavior before implementation and pass after the production changes.

## 2026-08-22 12:36:20 +08:00 — Task 12 first GREEN fixture mismatch

- Operation: Run the focused suites after the first implementation pass.
- Command: Same three-file focused Flutter test gate.
- Affected location: `practice_mission_evidence_service_test.dart` unauthenticated expectation and `mission_simulation_screen_test.dart` review-navigation fixtures.
- Observed result: The unauthenticated transport threw synchronously instead of through its `Future`, while review tests still attempted to reach submission using Continue-only navigation.
- Root cause: The service method lacked an `async` boundary, and pre-existing review fixtures encoded the exact behavior now prohibited by the completion gate.
- Primary solution: Make transport failure asynchronous and drive every catalog phase to its terminal action before advancing.
- Alternatives: Use `expect(() => ...)` for a synchronous API; add a controller fixture already seeded with phase completion evidence. Both were rejected because they would weaken the production contract or regression realism.
- Status: Resolved; unauthenticated access fails through the transport future and review tests exercise actual mission interactions.

## 2026-08-22 12:38:10 +08:00 — Task 12 review driver target mismatch

- Operation: Rerun the mission-screen review regression after adding terminal-action drivers.
- Command: Focused `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart` invocation.
- Affected location: The COC1 M1 multi-select phase test driver.
- Observed result: The driver searched for a definition-specific option key that the renderer normalizes to `multi-select-motherboard`.
- Root cause: The fixture guessed the widget key instead of following the renderer's established fallback key contract.
- Primary solution: Use the rendered stable key already asserted by interaction tests.
- Alternatives: Locate the option by visible label; expose a helper on the renderer for tests.
- Status: Resolved; the corrected key selects and confirms the phase.

## 2026-08-22 12:39:15 +08:00 — Task 12 review driver rebuild timing

- Operation: Rerun the review regression after correcting the multi-select target.
- Command: Focused `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart` invocation.
- Affected location: The COC1 M1 observation phase test driver.
- Observed result: The record button remained disabled immediately after text entry.
- Root cause: The test driver did not pump the rebuild that updates the button's enabled state.
- Primary solution: Pump once after `enterText`, then tap the now-enabled terminal action.
- Alternatives: Submit through the text field action; seed an observation action directly through the controller.
- Status: Resolved; the review regression now reaches review only after terminal evidence for every prior phase.

## 2026-08-22 12:42:30 +08:00 — Task 12 Supabase CLI unavailable

- Operation: Verify the Supabase CLI version and request migration command help before generating and testing the schema change.
- Commands: `supabase --version` and `supabase migration new --help`.
- Affected location: Local toolchain command resolution; migration source line not applicable.
- Observed result: PowerShell reported that `supabase` was not recognized for both invocations.
- Root cause: The Supabase CLI is not installed or exposed on PATH in this worktree shell.
- Primary solution: Add the chronologically named migration with the repository patch workflow, add rollback-lifecycle assertions, and report live execution as unverified rather than weakening the schema test.
- Alternatives: Run the repository migration/lifecycle suite in prepared CI; use an authorized local Supabase installation; validate against a disposable linked test project with protected credentials.
- Status: Tooling-blocked for local database execution; migration and lifecycle assertions are tracked for the prepared integration environment.

## 2026-08-22 12:43:25 +08:00 — Task 12 failure-ledger patch encoding mismatch

- Operation: Append the Task 12 review-fix failures to this ledger.
- Command/interaction: `apply_patch` anchored on the console-rendered final Unicode heading.
- Affected location: This documentation file; application code line not applicable.
- Observed result: Patch context verification failed because the console rendering did not match the file's encoded em dash bytes.
- Root cause: The patch used a lossy console representation of the Unicode heading as context.
- Primary solution: Anchor the append on the stable ASCII status line immediately below the heading.
- Alternatives: Inspect the final bytes with explicit UTF-8 decoding; append through a newly introduced ASCII sentinel.
- Status: Resolved; the ASCII-anchored patch appended all entries without rewriting existing history.

## 2026-08-22 12:52:30 +08:00 — Task 12 round 2 Supabase reference filename mismatch

- Operation: Read the RLS and upsert references required by the Supabase Postgres guidance.
- Command: `Get-Content` for guessed `security-rls.md` and `data-upserts.md` paths.
- Affected location: Local agent-skill reference lookup; repository code line not applicable.
- Observed result: PowerShell reported both guessed reference paths were absent; the foreign-key reference in the same command was read successfully.
- Root cause: The installed skill uses the more specific filenames `security-rls-basics.md`, `security-rls-performance.md`, and singular `data-upsert.md`.
- Primary solution: Enumerate the reference directory with `rg --files`, then read the exact relevant files in full.
- Alternatives: Follow the reference index if one is present; read the official Supabase RLS and PostgreSQL upsert documentation directly.
- Status: Resolved; all applicable local references and current official Supabase RLS/changelog material were reviewed before the schema edit.

## 2026-08-22 12:56:10 +08:00 — Task 12 round 2 retry-action RED

- Operation: Run the review-screen regression for retrying one locally pending evidence action without remounting.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart --plain-name "retry synchronizes the same pending evidence and unblocks submission"`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`; production review UI had no retry control.
- Observed result: The test found no `OutlinedButton` labelled `Retry pending evidence`.
- Root cause: Pending and failed counts disabled submission but exposed no user action that called `MissionRuntimeController.flushPending()`.
- Primary solution: Add an explicit review action wired to `flushPending()`, preserve the pending action ID, disable it in flight, and rebuild feedback/submission state on completion.
- Alternatives: Retry automatically on a timer; require exit/relaunch to trigger restore reconciliation. Both were rejected because the review requires an explicit in-place retry.
- Status: Resolved; the focused regression passes and records exactly the original pending client action ID.

## 2026-08-22 12:58:05 +08:00 — Task 12 round 2 active-learner RLS RED

- Operation: Verify that both practice-evidence policies include the repository's active learner predicate before changing the migration.
- Command: PowerShell policy-contract assertion counting `public.is_learner()` in `20260822124500_practice_mission_evidence.sql`.
- Affected location: Practice evidence `SELECT` and `INSERT` RLS policies.
- Observed result: The assertion expected two active-learner predicates and found zero.
- Root cause: Ownership and the PostgreSQL `authenticated` role were enforced, but application-role/status authorization was not.
- Primary solution: Combine `(select public.is_learner())` with `(select auth.uid()) = learner_id` in both policies.
- Alternatives: Duplicate the profile-role/status lookup inline; create a new helper function. Both were rejected in favor of the existing audited predicate and no new `SECURITY DEFINER` surface.
- Status: Resolved statically; both policies contain the active-learner predicate and lifecycle assertions cover instructor, admin, and deactivated-learner denial. Database execution remains pending the prepared Supabase environment.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Final catalog render RED

- Operation: Render every phase in the 20-mission catalog through its declared presentation contract.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart --plain-name "renders every catalog phase without technical unavailability"`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart:406` and the four COC definition files.
- Observed result: 28 of 116 phases resolved to `TechnicalUnavailable` because required tools, targets, choices, fields, diagnostics, or component contracts were absent.
- Root cause: Metadata families had been declared without complete renderer-owned presentation data.
- Primary solution: Populate each phase with meaningful mission-specific presentation data and add the exhaustive render contract.
- Alternatives: Add widget defaults or hardcoded feedback; rejected because it would hide catalog defects and violate data ownership.
- Status: Resolved; 116/116 phases render and the consolidated focused gate passes 100/100.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Canonical interaction-family RED

- Operation: Reject divergence between a phase's declared primary interaction and its resolved component family.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_runtime_models_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_runtime_models_test.dart:42` and `lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_models.dart`.
- Observed result: A declared decision phase could render a selection component, and COC1 M4 initially resolved to five families after canonical derivation.
- Root cause: Validation trusted metadata labels and a duplicated screen resolver instead of the component actually rendered.
- Primary solution: Introduce one canonical presentation resolver, derive the real family set, and reshape over-broad missions with meaningful combined or equivalent mechanics.
- Alternatives: Raise the 2-4 limit or relabel metadata; rejected because neither changes learner interaction.
- Status: Resolved; all 20 definitions validate against their actual 2-4 rendered family sets.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Full-action restore RED

- Operation: Rebuild runtime state from acknowledged server actions without a local snapshot and merge a stale snapshot with pending actions.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `ByteQuest-Mobile-App/test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart:39` and runtime transport/controller files.
- Observed result: Compilation failed on missing `AcknowledgedMissionEvidenceAction`, `readAcknowledgedActions`, `MissionRuntimeActionReducer`, and `restoreReducer`; the old controller returned immediately on a missing cache.
- Root cause: The transport exposed acknowledged IDs only, so accepted interaction state could not be reconstructed.
- Primary solution: Transport full ordered, identified RLS-scoped actions and reduce them from a clean initial state before de-duplicated pending actions.
- Alternatives: Trust stale local presentation state or evaluate locally; rejected because neither is server-reconciled and local evaluation is prohibited.
- Status: Resolved; no-cache rebuild, stale merge/de-duplication, offline preservation, and legacy runtime JSON tests pass.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Restore implementation compile and validation RED

- Operation: Run the first restore implementation against existing controller regressions.
- Command: `flutter test test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `lib/screens/simulation/runtime/mission_runtime_controller.dart:81` and `test/mission_runtime_controller_test.dart:263`.
- Observed result: Dart rejected nullable field promotion for the reducer; after correction, the mismatched pending-mission test observed one server read instead of zero.
- Root cause: The nullable reducer field was referenced directly inside closures, and pending evidence identity was validated after transport access.
- Primary solution: Capture the reducer in a local variable and validate all local pending mission IDs before any server request.
- Alternatives: Use forced null assertions; defer validation to reconciliation. Both were rejected as less safe.
- Status: Resolved; focused restore/gateway/service gate passes 23/23.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — TestRun terminal-action RED

- Operation: Protect configured evaluator action types from non-terminal test starts and verify two retests.
- Command: `flutter test test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart test/mission_catalog_acceptance_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart:543`, `test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart:342`, and `lib/screens/simulation/interactions/test_run_interaction.dart`.
- Observed result: The first event was `retest_requested` instead of `test_started`; catalog assertions also found legacy key names.
- Root cause: Both the widget and screen rewrote every TestRun event to the configured terminal evidence action.
- Primary solution: Keep starts as `test_started`, map only `test_completed` to `evidenceActionType`, retain legacy-key read compatibility, and preserve the canonical runtime type in action value.
- Alternatives: Introduce another terminal-looking start type; rejected because it would inflate evaluator counts.
- Status: Resolved; two runs produce exactly two configured terminal actions and two non-terminal starts.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Catalog connection scene RED

- Operation: Draw an accepted `router>switch` connection from the actual COC2 M3 catalog scene.
- Command: `flutter test test/simulation_scene_test.dart --plain-name "catalog object IDs resolve to connection nodes"`.
- Affected location: `test/simulation_scene_test.dart:134` and `lib/screens/simulation/components/simulation_scene.dart:510`.
- Observed result: The connection painter received zero segments.
- Root cause: Runtime stored canonical object IDs while scene lookup indexed only generated `*_port` IDs.
- Primary solution: Index each scene object ID as a node alias and add any catalog connection endpoints missing from the base scene object map.
- Alternatives: Rewrite accepted runtime evidence to presentation-only port IDs; rejected because it would destabilize evidence identity.
- Status: Resolved; the actual scene painter and all-catalog endpoint-resolution regressions pass.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Composite interpretation and restore-fixture RED

- Operation: Require an interpretation after combined test phases and rerun the full mission screen suite under server-first restore.
- Command: Focused composite widget test followed by `flutter test test/mission_catalog_acceptance_test.dart test/mission_phase_completion_policy_test.dart test/mission_simulation_screen_test.dart`.
- Affected location: `test/advanced_mission_interactions_test.dart:199` and mission-screen restore/lifecycle/retry fixtures.
- Observed result: The interpretation button was tapped before its enabled rebuild; three screen fixtures also assumed restore performed no server read/save/replay.
- Root cause: One widget driver missed a pump/visibility step, while legacy fixtures encoded the pre-fix local-cache-first restore contract.
- Primary solution: Pump and expose the enabled interpretation control, avoid no-op restore saves, and model offline retry with an existing local snapshot before clearing the simulated network error.
- Alternatives: Make interpretation optional or restore local state without server reconciliation; rejected because both weaken acceptance behavior.
- Status: Resolved; the composite drive test and full focused 100-test gate pass.

## 2026-08-22 13:54:55 +08:00 — Static SQL assertion wording mismatch

- Operation: Run static migration and rollback-lifecycle contract assertions.
- Command: PowerShell assertions over `20260822124500_practice_mission_evidence.sql` and `foundation_lifecycle_rollback.sql`.
- Affected location: Verification command only; repository SQL line not applicable.
- Observed result: Migration checks passed, but three lifecycle checks returned false because the probe searched guessed prose rather than the file's uppercase exception sentinels.
- Root cause: The verification script did not first inspect the established lifecycle assertion vocabulary.
- Primary solution: Read the relevant SQL block and assert the exact `PRACTICE_EVIDENCE_*`, role-denial, inactive-learner, and rollback sentinels.
- Alternatives: Treat the first false result as a schema defect; run a live database mutation without authorization. Both were rejected.
- Status: Resolved; all eight static SQL/lifecycle assertions pass. Live lifecycle execution remains unverified.
